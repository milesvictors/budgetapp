APP DESCRIPTION

This app is going to simplify the way we make budgets.  It will take in a variety of different information, including:

  - Gross Income
  - Net Income
  - Taxes paid
    - Federal
    - State
    - Municipal
  - Social Security
  - Health Plan
  - Various insurances (like death/disability/unemployment/etc)
  
It will also be preset to present a variety of different budgets that are editable.  Budgets will include:
  
  - Mortgage
    - This will also have the ability to break out the data for principal, interest, taxes, etc and calculate remaining principle, time to pay-off, etc
  - Utilities
    - Gas
    - Electric
    - Water/Sewer
  - Phone
  - Internet
  - Cable
  - Entertainment
  - Food
  - Gasoline/Travel
  - Savings
  
Also a debt payoff calculator using the 'snowball' method will be present to help with debt payoff.

Savings calculators will help you learn how you can save for big purchase items, retirement, vacations, etc.

Both Mobile and Web Browser friendly, along with dedicated Android, iOS, Blackberry, Symbian, and Windows Mobile applications.

Email alerts will also be a feature.

At this point in time, no account information will be held on the site. This will be a completely manual site at the start, and maybe 
there will be an implementation with tie-in options for your various financial accounts when security measures are
put in place and deemed stable.
